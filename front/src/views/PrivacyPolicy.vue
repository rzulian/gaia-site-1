    <h2>Emails</h2>

    <p>All email notifications (newsletter, game settings, etc.) are strictly opt-in. Those settings can be edited with one click in the user profile.</p>

    <h2>Personal Data</h2>

    <p>We use a mail delivery system hosted in Europe, which has strong privacy laws. Your email is not communicated to anyone else.</p>
    <p>We will never share your email address with any other third party, without your explicit approval first. We will never seek to profit
      from your personal data.
    </p>

    <p>We store your email address, username & last few IP addresses. We may in the future also store what kind of browser you are using. This data
      will only be used internally. The storing of IP addresses is used for account security and to prevent spam. If we stored browser data, it would
      be for debug purposes, and to evaluate what kind of browsers we need to support.
    </p>

      We do not use any cookies for unauthenticated users. There is only a single cookie for authenticated users, containing a reference to their session.
      Logging out will remove that cookie.
